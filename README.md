# Clustering-Algorithms-Analysis
This project compares K-Means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithms using the silhouette coefficient for evaluation. It includes outlier detection and removal, and allows users to customize the clustering process on a synthetic 3D dataset to identify the superior algorithm based on clustering quality.
